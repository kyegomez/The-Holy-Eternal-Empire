The Holy Eternal Empire takes its inspiration from the principles of technology-driven capitalism, while honoring the laws and commandments of the God of Humanity, Yahweh, as found in the Old Testament of the Bible. 

The primary goal of this government is to encourage creation and innovation, particularly in technology and commerce, while maintaining moral and ethical standards based on religious teachings. The primary governmental duties are ensuring fair trade and business practices, encouraging technological advancements, and maintaining adherence to the commandments.

Structure and Functionality:

1. **The Council of Innovation**: This body is the main driving force behind technological advancement. Comprising technologists, entrepreneurs, and investors, the Council's role is to fund, encourage, and develop innovation. They invest in startups, allocate resources for research and development, and set standards for technological practices. This body works under a market-driven approach, promoting competition while avoiding monopolies.

2. **The Ethics Board**: This body consists of religious scholars and ethicists who are well versed in the laws and commandments of Yahweh. Their role is to ensure that all societal actions, including technological innovations and market practices, are in alignment with these religious teachings. They can veto decisions of the Council of Innovation if they determine an initiative is contrary to the commandments.

3. **The Trade Commission**: This body oversees domestic and international trade, ensuring fair practices and encouraging the export of goods and services. They negotiate trade agreements, enforce regulations, and investigate unfair practices.

4. **The Individual**: In this system, each individual is both a creator and a consumer. They are encouraged to innovate and establish their own businesses, contribute to technological advancements, and trade their goods and services. The free market is the primary driving force, allowing individuals to accumulate wealth based on their own merit and creativity.

5. **The Court of Reconciliation**: If there's a dispute between the Council of Innovation, the Ethics Board, and the Trade Commission, this judicial body steps in to mediate and decide on the best course of action. Comprised of respected members from each sector, the Court ensures a balanced resolution that aligns with the principles of TTC.

Education and societal norms:

Education in TTC is based around technology, commerce, and religion. The educational system ensures each citizen is well-versed in technological skills, business acumen, and the commandments of Yahweh. Entrepreneurship is encouraged from a young age, with children being taught the importance of innovation and fair trade.

Societal norms and laws in TTC are based on the commandments of Yahweh. Citizens are expected to live and conduct their business according to these commandments. Government and society actively encourage obedience to these laws, both in personal and business dealings.

## Economic Objective:

The Holy Eternal Empire's purpose is to accelerate Humanity into a post-scarcity civilization. Achieving a state of infinite abundance and leading in innovation would require a combination of highly efficient resource management, technological advancement, and societal organization. Here are some structures and strategies The Holy Eternal Empire might adopt:

1. **Automated Production**: To achieve abundant and cheap products and services, this government would heavily invest in automation and artificial intelligence. Automated factories and service industries can drastically increase production efficiency and lower costs. This would require the Council of Innovation to support research and implementation of cutting-edge automation technologies.

2. **Advanced Resource Management**: Efficient use and recycling of resources would be critical. This could involve investing in green technologies, renewable energy sources, and sustainable manufacturing processes. Encouraging a circular economy, where waste from one industry becomes a resource for another, can greatly contribute to the abundance of goods.

3. **Decentralization of Production**: Technologies such as 3D printing and home-based manufacturing can help decentralize production, making it more locally accessible, reducing cost and waste associated with transportation, and contributing to product abundance.

4. **High-Speed Digital Infrastructure**: The government would need to invest heavily in the digital infrastructure to support a technologically advanced society. This includes high-speed internet, blockchain technologies for secure transactions, and other digital technologies.

5. **Universal Education**: To lead in innovation, the government would ensure access to high-quality education for all citizens. Emphasis would be on STEM education, critical thinking, and creativity, as well as business acumen and understanding of religious commandments.

6. **Supportive Legal and Financial Framework**: The government should create a favorable environment for entrepreneurship and innovation. This could include financial incentives for start-ups, patent laws that protect inventors, and regulations that encourage competition while preventing monopolies.

7. **Research and Development**: Allocating substantial funds for R&D can foster a culture of constant innovation. Collaborations with universities, private corporations, and international partners can further enhance this.
